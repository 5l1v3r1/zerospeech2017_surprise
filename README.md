# Getting started #
 
This document details how to registrate to the challenge, download the datasets and evaluation code and submit your results. If you are experiencing any issue, please contact us at zerospeech2017@gmail.com.
 
In principle, each team should make only ONE submission. A small number of submissions per team are tolerated (for instance, to compare a small number models; capped at 5 per team) so long as you pledge to report and discuss all of your submissions in the journal article.
 
Be careful when you submit your doi. Each submission is irreversible, as a doi object cannot be erase. It is also public, as everybody will have access to your code and results, including the reviewers of the paper, who will be asked to verify that you report and discuss all of your submitted results.
 
 
## System requirements ##
 
Any recent Linux system can be used. The evaluation code has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, Debian Jessie and CentOS 6 (should be OK on Mac OS too). It runs faster with a multicore machine (10 cores is a good number).
 
 
## Registration ##
 
You first need to register by sending an email to zerospeech2017@gmail.com.
 
* Registration is needed to download the challenge's data and submit your results for evaluation.
 
* We will keep you informed in case there is any update. 
 
 
## Datasets and evaluation code ##
 
To download the challenge evaluation code and datasets, please follow the instructions from the challenge's [github repository](https://github.com/bootphon/zerospeech2017).
 
Once done, you are ready to work on your model(s) and prepare your features for submission.
 
 
## Results directory format ##
 
Your system code and result files must be organized in a directory that you will submit as a *.tar.gz* archive. It must have the following structure:
 
    system/
        README
        distribution of your program, see below
    track1/
        README
        {english, french, mandarin, surprise1, surprise2}/
            {1s, 10s, 120s}/
                *.fea
    track2/
        README
        english.txt
        french.txt
        mandarin.txt
        surprise1.txt
        surprise2.txt
 
 
Valid submissions can contain only one of the tracks, and can have
missing data on one of the hyper training or test languages (in case
of a last minute bug, we will not prevent you from submitting if one
language is missing).
 
We request a `README` file in each subdirectory. They can have any (or
no) extension, e.g. `README.md` or `README.txt`.
 
 
### `system` directory ###
 
The `system` directory contains the program(s) you are using for the
challenge. It can be distributed as a DOI, sources or binary.
 
* DOI: If you have already published your code elsewhere and have an
  attached DOI, put that information in the README, along with a
  download URL. In that case, the `system` folder contains only the
  README (learn how to attach a zenodo DOI to a github
  repository
  [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)).
 
* Sources: If you do not have a DOI you can distribute your
  program as sources. In that case you are free to organize the
  `system` folder as you want. The README must describe the
  program, any software dependencies and the build process.
 
* Binary: We strongly encourage distribution from sources or DOI
  but, if you cannot release your sources, we also accept binary
  files. In that case the README must specify how to run the
  executable (system, dependencies, etc...). We will run it to
  check that it does generate the same files as the one you
  provide on the challenge's data.
 
In all cases, the `system` README must contain at least software
configuration (e.g. `uname -a`), hardware configuration (e.g. `sudo
lshw -short` or `cat /proc/cpuinfo`), libraries and dependencies.
 
 
### `track1` and `track2` directories ###
 
The `track1` and `track2` directories contain the results you obtained
on the 3 hypertrain datasets (`english`, `french` and `mandarin`) and
the 2 hypertest datasets (`surprise1` and `surprise2`) using your
`system`.
 
* If you are submitting only for one of the two tracks or if you have
  missing languages, delete the unused folders.
 
* The README files must contain the command and parameters used to
  generate the entire set of results. Importantly, the hyperparameters
  of your system should be *exactly the same* for the 5 languages.
  Here is a README exemple for track 2:
 
        for LANG in english french mandarin surprise1 surprise2
        do
            system/bin/my_spoken_term_disc -a 1 -b 2 -c 3 ~/data/$LANG/training > track2/$LANG.txt
        done
 
* The `track1` *.fea* files are the features computed on *test files* in
  the format specified
  [here](https://github.com/bootphon/zerospeech2017#features-file-format).
 
* The `track2` *.txt* files are the clusters computed on *train files*
  in the format specified
  [here](https://github.com/bootphon/zerospeech2017#evaluation-input-format)
 
 
## Directory validation and archive creation ##
 
The evaluation will fail if the archive is not in the correct format.
Make sure your result dircetory is ready for evaluation and convert it
to a *.tar.gz* using
[this script](https://github.com/bootphon/zerospeech2017/blob/master/submission/make_archive.sh)
from the challenge repository. Here is an exemple usage with the provided
[exemple archive](https://github.com/bootphon/zerospeech2017/blob/master/submission/exemple.tar.gz):
 
        $ cd zerospeech2017/submission
        $ tar xf exemple.tar.gz
        $ make_archive.sh exemple
        checking exemple/system... found
        checking exemple/system README... found exemple/system/README.txt
        checking exemple/{track1, track2} directories... found track1 track2
        checking exemple/track1 README... found exemple/track1/README.md
        [... more checks ...]
        checking exemple/track2/surprise1.txt... found
        checking exemple/track2/surprise2.txt... found
        success: exemple dircetory is valid and ready for evaluation
        creating exemple.tar.gz... done
        size of exemple:	68K
        size of exemple.tar.gz:	4,0K
 
You are limited to 50GB, this should be largly enough for the
challenge, if you have a bigger archive please contact us.
 
 
## Archive submission and evaluation ##
 
0. Sign up to zenodo on https://zenodo.org/signup/
 
1. Upload your *tar.gz* archive on
   [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/zerospeech2017) to get a
   DOI (digital object identifier).
 
    - Start a new upload into the zenodo zerospeech2017
     community [here](https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=zerospeech2017)
     and pre-reserve a DOI.
 
   - Name your archive as `$doi.tar.gz`, where `$doi` is your
     pre-reserved DOI.
 
   - The upload type must be *dataset* to allow the 5OGB limit.
 
   - Please be carefull before publishing as the archive becomes
     public and it can only be deleted by emailing zenodo.
 
2. Once the archive is published, the challenge organizers will
   receive a notification and an automated job will download and
   evaluate their features.
 
3. The evaluation results will be sent to you by email and published on the
   [challenge results page](http://sapience.dec.ens.fr/bootphon/2017/page_5.html)
   within 24h.
 
4. To submit another archive, you can go back to *(2)*. Maximum is 5
   submissions.
